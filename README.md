# Linear Regression and Gradient Descend


I wanted to implement real life example of Linear Regression where using dataset we can predict patients charge at the hospital. For example smoker patients usually pay more than non-smokers. So, it will be one of the factors to our Linear model to predict patient's charge. Or another main factor is BMI, patients with non-standart bmi score will spend more at the hospital.
